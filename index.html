            <h2>What is blockchain ?</h2><br>

            <p>Making payments through mobile phones, online digital or car payments it involves so many intermediates
                systems each of them plays respective roles in the process of payments, which is a long, complex and
                costly process. Typically it involved bank or large payment processing business who keeps tracing money
                from a buyer to merchant or producer to consumer etcâ€¦</p><br>

            <h2>What Blockchain can do ?</h2><br>

            <p>Without involving any intermediates is there any system reduce complicity, cost and time? Blockchain is a
                system we can store info which is nearly impossible to edit data or hack.
                Blockchain is not just for a payments tracking it involves in goods and info tracking, Blockchain can
                seem complicated and a little impenetrable, which is ironic as one of the core tenets of this technology
                is its openness and transparency.
            </p><br>
            <h2>How Blockchain works ?</h2><br>

            <p>Blockchain allows direct connection between consumer and producer without any need of
                intermediatePublics.
